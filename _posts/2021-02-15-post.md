<h5> Results </h5>

This paper extends [Cabrales et al. (2013)](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.103.1.360) and characterizes a partial order over information structures that is based on entropy but prior-free.

<ul> 
<li> Define i(p)
<ul>
<li> There exists an optimal methods-based contract that implements a binary, feasible, Blackwell-monotone experiment choice function. (binary: at most two signals; feasible: the cost of experiments doesn't explode; Blackwell-monotone: a lower-cost researcher chooses Blackwell-more informative experiment.) </li>
<li> No distortion at the top and garbling everywhere. (Maskin & Riley, 1984)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li> Results-based Contracts
 <ul>
<li> Any binary, feasible, Blackwell-monotone experiment choice function can be implemented with a result-based contract. We can construct such contract ``outwards'' (from the highest-cost to the lowest-cost). </li>
<li> Results-based implementation requires Blackwell-monotonicity. </li>
</ul>
 </li>
</ul>

<h5> Insights </h5>
<ul>
 <li> A comparative statics result is the key: More convex information design problems have Blackwell-more informative solutions. (Quasisupermodularity needs not hold here)
 </li>
</ul>
